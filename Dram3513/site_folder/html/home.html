I am currently going to Edmonds College to get a transfer degree in Web Development.I've learned alot of new skills
since I started going to the college. I am hoping that one day I will get my BA Degree in Web Development so that
i'll have a great chance of landing a good job at one of the big teach companies. Currentlly I am also emloyed
as a caregiver at Sunrise Services, I really enjoy the job because It gives me an opportunity to take care of those
